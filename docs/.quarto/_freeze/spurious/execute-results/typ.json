The regression output “looks good” because the least-squares estimates are not consistent and the customary tests of statistical inference do not hold.\n\n## {.fragment} \n\n--- \n\n**CASE 1:** Both  {yt} and {zt} are stationary. The classical regression model is appropriate.\n\n\n**CASE 2:** The {yt} and {zt} sequences are integrated of different orders. Regression equations using such variables are meaningless. \n\n**CASE 3:** The nonstationary {yt} and {zt} sequences are integrated of the same order and the residual sequence contains a stochastic trend. This is the case in which the regression is spurious. In this case, it is often recommended that the regression equation be estimated in first differences. \n\n\n---\n**CASE 4:** The nonstationary {yt} and {zt} sequences are integrated of the same order and the residual sequence is stationary. In this circumstance, {yt} and {zt} are cointegrated.\n\n## Load libraries and generate data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse) # An umbrella package that installs the tidyverse packages\n\nlibrary(readxl) # To read excel files\n\nlibrary(broom) # To tidy up the regression output\n\nlibrary(moderndive) # To get regression points\n\nlibrary(ggfortify) # To plot regression diagnostics\n\nlibrary(ggResidpanel) # To plot regression diagnostics\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nT <- 1000\nset.seed(1357)\ny <- ts(rep(0,T))\nvy <- ts(rnorm(T))\nfor (t in 2:T){\n  y[t] <- y[t-1]+vy[t]\n}\n\nset.seed(4365)\nx <- ts(rep(0,T))\nvx <- ts(rnorm(T))\nfor (t in 2:T){\n  x[t] <- x[t-1]+vx[t]\n}\ny <- ts(y[300:1000])\nx <- ts(x[300:1000])\nts.plot(y,x, ylab=\"y and x\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spurious_files/figure-typst/unnamed-chunk-2-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# barplot of residuals\nresid <- residuals(lm(y~x))\nbarplot(resid, ylab=\"Residuals\", xlab=\"Observation\", main=\"Residuals of y~x\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spurious_files/figure-typst/unnamed-chunk-3-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n## Residuals panel\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nresid_panel(lm(y~x))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](spurious_files/figure-typst/unnamed-chunk-4-1.svg)\n:::\n:::\n\n",
