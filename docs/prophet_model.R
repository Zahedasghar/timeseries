
# Facebookâ€™s time series forecasting package Prophet~ is designed for analyzing
# time series that display patterns on different time scales such as yearly,
# weekly, and daily. It also has advanced capabilities for modeling the effects
# of holidays on a time series and implementing custom changepoints. Prophet is
# robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers
# well. It is used in many applications across Facebook for producing reliable 
# forecasts for planning and goal setting.~
