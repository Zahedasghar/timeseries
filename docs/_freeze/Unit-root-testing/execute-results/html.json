If they agree on the presence or absence of a unit root, you can be more confident in the conclusion.\n\n\n## \n\n![](images/paste-E90AFB05.png)\n\n\n## Three main aspects of Unit root testing\n\n-   Determining components (constant , time trend).\n\n-   ADF test- lag length , use F-test or Schwarz Information Criteria\n\n-   In what sequence should we test?\n\n-   Phi and tau tests\n\n## Three Strategy for Unit Roots\n\nFormal Strategy  \n\n1.

The theory underlying the test is very simple: if you have n independent and unbiased estimates of a parameter, the mean of the estimates is also unbiased. More importantly, so long as the estimates are independent, the central limit theory suggests that the sample mean will be normally distributed around the true mean. \n\n-     The difficult issue is to correct for cross equation correlation\n\n-   Because the lag lengths can differ across equations, you should perform separate lag length tests for each equation. Moreover, you may choose to exclude the deterministic time trend. However, if the trend is included in one equation, it should be included in all\n\n## Limitations \n-   The null hypothesis for the IPSE test $\\gamma_1=\\gamma_2=...=\\gamma_1=0$. Reject of the null hypothesis means that at least  one of the $\\gamma_i's$ differs from zero. \n\n-   At this point, there is substantial disagreement about the asymptotic theory underlying the test. Sample size can approach infinity by increasing n for a given T, increasing T for a given n, or by simultaneously increasing n and T. \n  -   For small T and large n, the critical values are dependent on the magnitudes of the various $\\beta_{ij}$. \nThe test requires that that the error terms be serially uncorrelated and contemporaneously uncorrelated. \nYou can determine the values of $p_i$ to ensure that the autocorrelations of $\\epsilon_{it}$ are zero. Nevertheless, the errors may be contemporaneously correlated in that $E(\\epsilon_{it}\\epsilon_{jt})\\neq 0$\nThe example above illustrates a common technique to correct for correlation across equations. As in the example, you can subtract a common time effect from each observation. However, there is no assurance that this correction will completely eliminate the correlation. Moreover, it is quite possible that  is nonstationary. Subtracting a nonstationary component from each sequence is clearly at odds with the notion that the variables are stationary. \n\n\n\n\n",
