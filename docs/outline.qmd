## Course Overview and Learning Outcomes

Research in economics, business and finance requires extensive use of sophisticated and refined quantitative skills. This course provides a comprehensive introduction to modern macroeconomic forecasting methods, combining traditional econometric approaches with contemporary machine learning techniques. Students will master the art and science of forecasting economic variables, with special attention to emerging sectors like renewable energy, technological adoption, and digital economies that often defy conventional modeling approaches.

**Upon completion, students will be able to:**
- Decompose complex time series into constituent components using advanced visualization and statistical methods
- Apply appropriate econometric models to various types of macroeconomic data
- Understand and implement dynamic macroeconometric models for policy analysis
- Estimate and interpret both univariate and multivariate time series models
- Utilize machine learning techniques for non-linear and high-dimensional forecasting problems
- Handle unconventional data sources and forecast technology-driven variables (solar energy adoption, digital payment systems, etc.)
- Conduct seasonal adjustment using X-12 ARIMA and advanced methods
- Integrate multiple data sources for robust forecasting frameworks
- Critically evaluate forecast performance and uncertainty

## Instructional Method

**Structure** -- The course integrates three complementary approaches: 

1. **Traditional Econometrics**: Foundation in time series analysis and classical forecasting 

2. **Modern Machine Learning**: Advanced techniques for complex, non-linear patterns 

3. **Applied Innovation**: Real-world applications including renewable energy forecasting, technology adoption curves, and digital economy indicators 


Students will learn through hands-on practice using R, Python, and specialized forecasting software, working with both conventional macroeconomic data and emerging technology-related datasets.
