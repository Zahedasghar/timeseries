## Trend-cycle
\fontsize{12}{14}\sf
\begin{block}{}
Additive decomposition: $y_t = T_t+S_t+R_t = \hat{T}_t + \hat{S}_t + \hat{R}_t$\\
Multiplicative decomposition: $y_t = T_t\times S_t\times R_t = \hat{T}_t\times \hat{S}_t\times\hat{R}_t$\end{block}
\pause


 * Estimate $\hat{T}$ using $(2\times m)$-MA if $m$ is even. Otherwise, estimate $\hat{T}$ using $m$-MA

Compute de-trended series

  * Additive decomposition: $y_t-\hat{T}_t$
  * Multiplicative decomposition: $y_t/\hat{T}_t$



**De-trending**

Remove smoothed series $\hat{T}_t$ from $y_t$ to leave $S_t$ and $R_t$.

  * Additive model: $y_t-\hat{T}_t  = (\hat{T}_t+\hat{S}_t+\hat{R}_t) - \hat{T}_t = \hat{S}_t+\hat{R}_t$
  * Multiplicative model: $\frac{y_t}{\hat{T}_t} = \frac{\hat{T}_t\times \hat{S}_t\times \hat{R}_t}{\hat{T}_t} = \hat{S}_t\times \hat{R}_t$

## Estimating seasonal component

  *  Seasonal index for each season is estimated as an \orange{average} of the detrended series for that season of successive  years.
  * E.g., take averages across all Januaries to get $S^{(1)}$ if your data is monthly. 
  * If necessary, adjust the seasonal indices so that:
    * for additive: $S^{(1)}+S^{(2)}+\ldots+S^{(12)}=0$ 
    * for multiplicative: $S^{(1)}+S^{(2)}+\ldots+S^{(12)}=m$
  * The seasonal component $\hat{S}_t$ simply consists of replications of the seasonal indices.


## Remainder component

Additive decomposition: $\hat{R}_t = y_t - \hat{T}_t - \hat{S}_t$

Multiplicative decomposition: $\hat{R}_t = y_t / (\hat{T}_t\hat{S}_t)$

### Classical decomposition

  *  Choose additive or multiplicative depending on which gives the most stable components.
  *  For multiplicative model, this method of estimation is known as \orange{ratio-to-moving-average method}.

## Comments on classical decomposition

  *  Estimate of trend is \orange{unavailable} for first few and last few observations.
  *  \orange{Seasonal component repeats} from year to year. May not be realistic.
  *  \orange{Not robust to outliers}.
  *  Newer methods designed to overcome these problems.
